# Creating a Full Stack Web Application with Python, NPM, Webpack and React

This project shows you how to build a basic web application using popular web technologies 
like NPM, Webpack, React and Python.


## Let's Build It Together!

You can find a walkthrough of how to build this application from scratch on
[my blog](https://codeburst.io/creating-a-full-stack-web-application-with-python-npm-webpack-and-react-8925800503d9).


## Jumping to Different Completion Points

You can use the git tags to jump to different completion points in the code.

If you go to the [BASIC_E2E_TEMPLATE](https://github.com/angineering/FullStackTemplate/tree/BASIC_E2E_TEMPLATE)
tag, you will find the application as it will be when you've followed the first blog post to the end.
You will have a basic web application with a Python backend and a React front-end, but they won't be passing
any data between each other yet.
